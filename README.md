# Master_Project  
The code to produce the presented results is:  
  - optimized.py for the simulations in the coexistence part  
  - disturbance2.py for the simulations in the disturbance part
    
The code to analyse the presented results is :
  - code_analysis_MP_AitanaRaldaCorfas.R 

The raw data are:  
  - rawdata_1_coexistence.csv for the coexistence simulations
  - rawdata_2_05.csv for the comparison with specialization score of 0.5
  - rawdata_3_firstRG.csv for the comparison between first or random resources given
  - rawdata_4_disturbance.csv for the disturbance simualtions
  - rawdata_5_dbcomparison.csv for the comparison with different sparcity
